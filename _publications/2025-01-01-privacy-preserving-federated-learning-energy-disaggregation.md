This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving federated learning approach for energy disaggregation in smart homes. The proposed method enables collaborative learning across multiple households while maintaining data privacy and security. Our approach addresses the challenges of energy disaggregation in distributed environments where data privacy is paramount.

**Key Contributions:**
- Novel federated learning framework for energy disaggregation
- Privacy-preserving mechanisms for collaborative learning
- Experimental validation on real-world smart home datasets
- Performance comparison with existing centralized approaches

**Results:** The proposed method achieves comparable accuracy to centralized learning while ensuring data privacy across participating households.
