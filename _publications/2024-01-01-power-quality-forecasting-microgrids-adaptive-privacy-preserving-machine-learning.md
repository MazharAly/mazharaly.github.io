This paper presents an adaptive privacy-preserving machine learning approach for power quality forecasting in microgrids. The proposed method addresses the critical challenge of maintaining data privacy while ensuring accurate power quality predictions in distributed energy systems.

**Methodology:**
- Adaptive federated learning framework for power quality forecasting
- Privacy-preserving mechanisms for collaborative model training
- Real-time adaptation to changing grid conditions
- Integration with existing microgrid control systems

**Experimental Results:**
- Improved forecasting accuracy compared to traditional methods
- Reduced privacy risks through federated learning
- Scalable solution for large-scale microgrid deployments
- Real-time performance validation on testbed systems

**Impact:** The proposed approach enables secure and accurate power quality forecasting while protecting sensitive operational data in microgrid environments.
