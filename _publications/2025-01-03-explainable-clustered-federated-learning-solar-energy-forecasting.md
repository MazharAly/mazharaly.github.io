This paper introduces an explainable clustered federated learning framework for solar energy forecasting. The proposed approach combines the benefits of federated learning with explainable AI techniques to provide interpretable predictions while maintaining data privacy across distributed solar installations.

**Innovative Features:**
- Clustered federated learning for heterogeneous solar installations
- Explainable AI integration for interpretable predictions
- Privacy-preserving model aggregation
- Real-time forecasting capabilities

**Technical Contributions:**
- Novel clustering algorithm for federated learning
- Explainability mechanisms for solar energy predictions
- Adaptive model updates based on weather patterns
- Performance optimization for edge devices

**Validation:** Extensive experiments demonstrate improved forecasting accuracy and enhanced interpretability compared to traditional approaches.
